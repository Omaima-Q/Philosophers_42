## Threads
A thread is a single sequence stream within a process. 
Because threads have some of the properties of processes, they are sometimes called lightweight processes. 
But unlike processes, threads are not independent from each other unlike processes. 
They share with other threads their code section, data section and OS resources like open files and signals. 
But, like processes, a thread has its own program counter (PC), a register set, and a stack space.
